-- Today Sales Data Issue Analysis and Fix
-- The issue is likely in frontend timezone/date handling

-- =====================================================
-- 1. FIRST: Run this diagnostic to see what data exists
-- =====================================================

-- Check current server time and timezone
SELECT 
  'Database Info' as category,
  NOW() as server_time,
  CURRENT_DATE as server_date,
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' as utc_time,
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Manila' as manila_time;

-- Check all sales data with timestamps
SELECT 
  'Sales Data' as category,
  id,
  total,
  created_at,
  created_at AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' as utc_time,
  created_at AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Manila' as manila_time,
  created_at::date as sale_date,
  CASE 
    WHEN created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE THEN '‚úÖ TODAY'
    WHEN created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1 THEN 'üìÖ YESTERDAY' 
    WHEN created_at::date > CURRENT_DATE - 7 THEN 'üìÜ THIS WEEK'
    ELSE 'üìã OLDER'
  END as period_label
FROM sales 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 10;

-- Count sales by date to see distribution
SELECT 
  created_at::date as sale_date,
  count(*) as transaction_count,
  sum(total) as total_revenue,
  CASE 
    WHEN created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE THEN 'üéØ TODAY'
    WHEN created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE - 1 THEN 'YESTERDAY'
    ELSE 'OTHER'
  END as day_label
FROM sales 
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY created_at::date
ORDER BY sale_date DESC;

-- =====================================================
-- 2. TEST TODAY'S SALES WITH DIFFERENT DATE METHODS
-- =====================================================

-- Method 1: Database date comparison (what your DB sees as "today")
SELECT 
  'Method 1: Database TODAY' as method,
  count(*) as transactions,
  coalesce(sum(total), 0) as revenue
FROM sales 
WHERE created_at::date = CURRENT_DATE;

-- Method 2: 24-hour window from now
SELECT 
  'Method 2: Last 24 hours' as method,
  count(*) as transactions,
  coalesce(sum(total), 0) as revenue
FROM sales 
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Method 3: Today from midnight (what frontend might expect)
SELECT 
  'Method 3: Since midnight today' as method,
  count(*) as transactions,
  coalesce(sum(total), 0) as revenue
FROM sales 
WHERE created_at >= date_trunc('day', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

-- Method 4: Philippine timezone today (if your users are in Philippines)
SELECT 
  'Method 4: Manila timezone today' as method,
  count(*) as transactions,
  coalesce(sum(total), 0) as revenue
FROM sales 
WHERE (created_at AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Manila')::date = (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Manila')::date;

-- =====================================================
-- 3. CREATE TEST DATA IF NONE EXISTS FOR TODAY
-- =====================================================

-- Check if we have today's data, if not create some
