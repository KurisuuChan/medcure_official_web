-- Truncate All Tables Script
-- MedCure Pharmacy Management System
-- =====================================================

-- WARNING: This script will permanently delete ALL DATA from all tables.
-- Table structures will remain intact, but all records will be removed.
-- This action is IRREVERSIBLE. Make sure to backup your data first!

-- =====================================================
-- 1. BACKUP VERIFICATION
-- =====================================================

-- Check current record counts before truncation

-- =====================================================
-- 2. DISABLE FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS TEMPORARILY
-- =====================================================

-- Disable triggers to prevent constraint violations during truncation

-- =====================================================
-- 3. TRUNCATE TABLES IN CORRECT ORDER
-- =====================================================

-- Start with child tables (those with foreign keys) first
-- Then move to parent tables

-- 3.1 Truncate sale_items first (child of sales and products)
TRUNCATE TABLE sale_items RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

-- 3.2 Truncate sales (parent of sale_items, child of none)
TRUNCATE TABLE sales RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

-- 3.3 Truncate products (parent table, referenced by sale_items)
TRUNCATE TABLE products RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

-- 3.4 Truncate notifications (independent table)
TRUNCATE TABLE notifications RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

-- 3.5 Truncate app_settings (independent table)
TRUNCATE TABLE app_settings RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

-- 3.6 Truncate audit tables (if they exist)
TRUNCATE TABLE archive_logs RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE stock_audit_log RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

-- 3.7 Truncate any remaining backup or utility tables
TRUNCATE TABLE products_backup_before_stock_fix RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;
TRUNCATE TABLE inventory_adjustments RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;

-- =====================================================
-- 4. RE-ENABLE FOREIGN KEY CONSTRAINTS
-- =====================================================

-- Re-enable triggers
SET session_replication_role = DEFAULT;

-- =====================================================
-- 5. RESET SEQUENCES (Auto-increment IDs)
-- =====================================================

-- Reset all sequences to start from 1
ALTER SEQUENCE products_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;
ALTER SEQUENCE sales_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;
ALTER SEQUENCE sale_items_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;
ALTER SEQUENCE notifications_id_seq RESTART WITH 1;

-- Reset audit log sequences if they exist

-- 6. VERIFICATION - Check Empty Tables
-- =====================================================
