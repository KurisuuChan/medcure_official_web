/**
 * DEPRECATED: Mock API has been replaced with real Supabase backend
 *
 * This file is no longer used. The application now uses:
 * - Real Supabase database
 * - Professional service layer (/src/services/)
 * - React Query hooks (/src/hooks/)
 *
 * If you see imports from this file, please update them to use the new backend:
 * - Import hooks from /src/hooks/useProducts.js instead
 * - Use the real data services from /src/services/
