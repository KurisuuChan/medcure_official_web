# Settings Persistence Fix - MedCure Pharmacy System

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Missing Database Tables

**Problem**: The settings service was trying to use database tables (`user_profiles`, `business_settings`, `app_settings`) that didn't exist in your migration scripts.

**Solution**: Created `database/settings_tables_migration.sql` with:

- User profiles table for personal information and avatars
- Business settings table for branding (logo, name, colors)
- App settings table for system preferences
- Storage buckets for avatars and business assets
- Row Level Security policies
- Proper indexes for performance

### 2. Poor localStorage Persistence

**Problem**: Settings were not persisting properly across page reloads due to:

- Improper JSON serialization/deserialization
- Race conditions in data loading
- No fallback error handling

**Solution**: Enhanced `src/services/settingsService.js` with:

- Safe localStorage operations with error handling
- Better fallback mechanisms
- Improved data validation
- Consistent storage keys
- Proper error logging

### 3. Component Update Issues

**Problem**: Settings changes weren't immediately reflected in other components like Header and Sidebar.

**Solution**: Enhanced Settings component to:

- Dispatch custom events when settings update
- Use refs to maintain current state for event dispatching
- Trigger storage events for better component synchronization
- Add better debugging/logging

## What You Need to Do

### Step 1: Run the Settings Migration

Execute the new migration script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of database/settings_tables_migration.sql
-- This will create the necessary tables and storage buckets
```

### Step 2: Test the Settings Functionality

1. **Go to Settings Page**:

   - Open your app and navigate to `/settings`
   - Try updating your profile name and saving
   - Upload a profile picture
   - Update business name and logo
   - Change app settings (theme, currency, etc.)

2. **Test Persistence**:

   - After making changes, refresh the page
   - Settings should persist and remain visible
   - Navigate to other pages and back to confirm

3. **Test Component Updates**:
   - Update business name in settings
   - Check if the sidebar shows the new name immediately
   - Update profile picture and check if header updates

### Step 3: Verify Storage Buckets

In your Supabase dashboard:

1. Go to Storage section
2. Verify these buckets exist:
   - `avatars` (for profile pictures)
   - `business-assets` (for business logos)
3. Check that upload policies are working

### Expected Behavior After Fix

✅ **Profile Settings**:

- Name updates persist across reloads
- Profile pictures upload and persist
- Changes reflect immediately in header

✅ **Business Settings**:

- Business name updates persist
- Logo uploads work and persist
- Changes reflect immediately in sidebar

✅ **App Settings**:

- Theme, currency, notifications persist
- Low stock thresholds save properly
- All preferences maintained on reload

✅ **Storage**:

- Files upload to Supabase Storage if authenticated
- Fallback to base64 encoding if storage unavailable
- Images display properly and persist

## Debugging Tips

If settings still don't persist:

1. **Check Browser Console**:

   - Look for error messages during save operations
   - Check for localStorage errors
   - Verify network requests to Supabase

2. **Check Supabase**:

   - Verify migration ran successfully
   - Check if tables were created
   - Verify storage buckets exist

3. **Test localStorage Directly**:

   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   console.log(localStorage.getItem("medcure_user_profile"));
   console.log(localStorage.getItem("medcure_business_settings"));
   console.log(localStorage.getItem("medcure_app_settings"));
   ```

4. **Test Database Connection**:
   - Try other features that use Supabase
   - Check if authentication is working
   - Verify your Supabase config

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/settingsService.js` - Enhanced with better persistence
2. `src/pages/Settings.jsx` - Improved event dispatching
3. `database/settings_tables_migration.sql` - New migration for settings tables

The settings should now work reliably with proper persistence and immediate updates across all components!
